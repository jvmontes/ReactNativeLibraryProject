# Welcome to the ReactNativeLibraryProject

This is an app intended to be used to learn React Native mobile app development.

The purpose of this application is to serve as a library for content, separated by category including Nutritional Wellness, Financial Literacy, and more. 

#### Set Up

This article contains some great steps for setting up your development environment: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup 

Below are the tools you will need to build the React Native app on your machine:
 - Homebrew
 - Node
 - Watchman

#### Running the iOS app created using react-native-cli

I highly recommend using the command line interface to interact with the application. This helps understand how all the components come together and get the mobile experience working. From the command line, use `npx react-native run-ios` to run the app. 

Alternatively, you can also use Xcode to open the `ReactNativeLibraryProject.xcworkspace` found under the `ios` directory and press Play.
